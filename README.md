  # Social Network API

  ## Description

   Social networks are an integral part of the modern digital landscape and it is important that every developer understand their functionality. This is the backend for a mock social network that has users who have friends, are able to share thoughts and are able to react to other's thoughts. Users and Thoughts can be created, read, updated and deleted, friends can be added to users and deleted and reactions can be added to thoughts and deleted. Like the vast majority of social media applications, this uses the popular NoSQL database MongoDB and Mongoose for its Object Data Modeling Library. There is no front end here, it is just a mock backend to demonstrate functionality.
